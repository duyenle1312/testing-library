If you're new to contribute to Open Source, check out [Hacktoberfest 2022](hacktoberfest.com) for more useful resources on how to get started!

Make sure your pull request satisfies the following guidelines:

- The PR title is in the format of "Add testing-framework for programming-language"
- For the URL of the tool/framework, you could either use a beginner-friendly tutorial anywhere on the Internet, the GitHub repo or the official website of the framework
- Search for previous successfully merged PR to take it as an example before making a new one
- New languages, and suggestions are always welcome
- Add your new entry at the bottom within the category
- You could also add a testing tool that is not for a particular programming language too, for instance, Reflect and Cypress
